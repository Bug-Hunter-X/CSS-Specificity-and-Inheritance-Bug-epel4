The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and ensuring the desired styles override others. Here's the corrected code:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue; 
}

.child {
  color: red; 
}

.parent .child {
  color: green; /* This style is intended to override the color of .child */
}

.child.special {
  color: purple !important; /*Use !important to ensure this style takes precedence*/
}

<div class="parent">
  <div class="child special"></div>
</div>
```

Using `!important` is generally discouraged for maintainability, but in certain scenarios where overriding inherent styles is crucial, it may be acceptable.  A better approach often involves restructuring the CSS selectors to ensure higher specificity without the need for `!important`.
